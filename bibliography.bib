    abstract = { This work investigates the pose graph optimization problem, which arises in maximum likelihood approaches to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). State-of-the-art approaches have been demonstrated to be very efficient in medium- and large-sized scenarios; however, their convergence to the maximum likelihood estimate heavily relies on the quality of the initial guess. We show that, in planar scenarios, pose graph optimization has a very peculiar structure. The problem of estimating robot orientations from relative orientation measurements is a quadratic optimization problem (after computing suitable regularization terms); moreover, given robot orientations, the overall optimization problem becomes quadratic. We exploit these observations to design an approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate, which does not require the availability of an initial guess. The approximation, named LAGO (Linear Approximation for pose Graph Optimization), can be used as a stand-alone tool or can bootstrap state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. We provide analytical results on existence and sub-optimality of LAGO, and we discuss the factors influencing its quality. Experimental results demonstrate that LAGO is accurate in common SLAM problems. Moreover, it is remarkably faster than state-of-the-art techniques, and is able to solve very large-scale problems in a few seconds. }

title="Realization and swimming performance of the breaststroke by a swimming humanoid robot",
journal="ROBOMECH Journal",
year="2016",
volume="3",
number="1",
pages="10",
abstract="In order to clarify the mechanics of human swimming, a full-body swimming humanoid robot called ``SWUMANOID'' was developed as an experimental platform for research about human swimming. SWUMANOID had a detailed human body shape, created using three-dimensional scanning and printing equipment, and was developed as an experimental model substituting for human subjects. Not only the appearance but also the methodology to realize various swimming strokes was considered. In order to reproduce complicated swimming motions with high fidelity, 20 waterproof actuators were installed. The free swimming of the crawl stroke at a velocity of 0.24m/s was realized in the previous study. However, it could not perform the breaststroke due to mechanical limitations. The objectives of this study were to realize the breaststroke for SWUMANOID by improving its lower limbs, and to investigate the swimming performance of the breaststroke experimentally. The lower body of SWUMANOID was fully redesigned, built, and connected to the upper body. The swimming motion of the breaststroke was created based on that of an actual swimmer. A free swimming experiment was conducted in a 25m outdoor swimming pool. In addition, in order to discuss the experimental results in detail, the experiment was reproduced by the simulation. From the experiment, it was found that SWUMANOID could perform the breaststroke successfully. The swimming speed for the stroke cycle of 2.3s was found to be 0.12m/s. Since this swimming speed was considered low compared to that of the actual swimmer, the reason for the discrepancy was examined by simulation. From the simulation, it was found that one main reason for the low swimming speed was insufficient output power of the motors, especially for the knee and shoulder joints.",

    abstract = { This paper introduces an innovative wall-climbing robot. The robot consists of two single-body negative pressure adsorption robots which could dock together as a mother-robot or separate into two independent child-robots. The child-robots connect with each other through a docking mechanism which can not only lock solidly and unlock smoothly but which can also adjust the relative position of the two child-robots. This design guarantees that while in dock mode the mother robot will be able to cross some barriers which are impossible to surmount for a single-body wall-climbing robot, while in separate mode the child-robots maintain agility and mobility compared to other two-body robots. In this paper, an overview of the mechanical structure of the robot is first presented and then three possible mechanisms for barrier-crossing are discussed and a reasonable one is selected. An analysis of the initial docking condition of the selected design is also given which provides the basis for the experiments and research for the future. }
